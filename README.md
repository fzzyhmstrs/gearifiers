### An RPG-themed mod that adds modifiers to all sorts of equippable gear. 

Find a _Razor Sharp_ sword in a chest, or maybe a _Blunt_ one.... Hone it up in the grindstone! Reroll modifiers in the Inlaying Table. Aims to provide that RPG-loot feeling of opening chests to find equipment with all sorts of different affixes.
